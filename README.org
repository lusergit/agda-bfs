* BFS graph traversal in agda
  This project is an implementation and correctness proof of a bfs
  traversal implementation in an undirected graph. The claim is that
  given a graph and two nodes (start and finish) the algorithm returns
  the shortest path between them (minimizes the number of hops between
  the two).
** Testing
   Testing can be done by writting a test (in ~test.agda~) and then
   #+begin_src sh
     agda src/Tests.agda
   #+end_src
   (some examples are already included)
** Verification
   Proving the algorithm correctness consists in
   #+begin_src sh
     agda src/Verification.agda
   #+end_src
